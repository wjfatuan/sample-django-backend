# Backend app with Django

As part of this sample project, we have created a backend application using Django.

## Requirements

This application uses `pipenv` to manage dependencies and Python 3. All dependencies are stored in the Pipfile of the project.
Required libraries includes:

* django
* django-rest-framework

These two libraries are the core of the functionality implemented for the backend.
